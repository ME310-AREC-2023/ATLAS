# ATLAS Management Tool

The not-a-dashboard management toolbox for the Facility/Building Manager.

To use:
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Ensure that php is installed. You can use homebrew to install php.
3. On your terminal, once you go inside the downloaded folder, type and enter "php -S localhost:6969".
4. On your browser, open "localhost:6969".

NOTE: Ensure you're connected to the same WiFi as the gateway. Edit the php files so that it gathers data from the correct IP addresses for InfluxDB and mySQL. If you're using the cloud, edit the php files accordingly.
